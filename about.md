## Me

For as long as I can remember I've been curious as to how and why things work and interact with their environment. From a very young age I was fortunate enough to realize that technology enabled us to more easily decipher those problems. Problems that I wanted to play a part in solving.

I currently specialize in data analysis & programming automation via SQL Server and it's associated tools. However, I have a passion for all things technology, specifically; Mac OS X and iOS software (those pertaining to Social Media or Productivity especially), User Interface & Front End Design, and the social psychology that drives trends in different markets (see [Freakonomics](http://freakonomics.com/about/))

## The blog
The blog on this site probably won't follow any specific trend or topic. Time has proven, it'll likely usually be out dated as well. For the foreseeable future I plan on using it to practice writing about topics and discussions (probably in the realm of technology) that interest me. I believe strongly that discussion in society is extremely important, so please feel free to join in on the conversation and share your opinions! :)
