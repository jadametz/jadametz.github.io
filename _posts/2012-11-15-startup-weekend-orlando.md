For anyone who doesn't know what Startup Weekend is, let's start there. "[Startup Weekends](http://startupweekend.org/about/) are 54-hour events where developers, designers, marketers, product managers and startup enthusiasts come together to share ideas, form teams, build products, and launch startups!"

I stole that quote from their site because it really explains it much better than the one I've been giving: "So I did this thing this weekend, that went from Friday night to Sunday night where we took an idea and turned it in to a _real thing_." Although, that's exactly what it was. Of the 54 hours I counted I was there with my team working on this for 37 of them! And to be clear from the start, those 37 hours were a blast.

## First Impressions
I got to the event Friday around 6:30p. I wanted to get there pretty early as to not miss anything at the start. Having never been to one of these events (or any of the other Entrepreneur/Developer meetup's in Orlando) I wanted to make sure I was already there as people arrived, join in on any interesting conversations, and meet some of the people that I knew I'd be working with over the weekend. This was probably the first indication of how the weekend was going to go. Everyone was willing to chat about their ideas, their experience, and what they were looking to get out of the upcoming weekend. It was a relaxed and productive environment from the start. It got me truly excited!

The space for the weekend was [Voxeo's](http://voxeons.com/voxeo-office/). Located on the 10th floor of the Plaza building in downtown Orlando, I really don't think the view of the city, available space to work in, and location could have been any better.

## The Format
Startup Weekend gets up and going really quick (makes sense; every one of those 54 hours were necessary to do what we had to). 

+ 100+ participants
+ 44 ideas pitched
+ 15 teams formed (consisting mostly of 6-8 people per team)
+ 51 hours remaining to get it done!

## My Experience: [Fuelzee](http://www.fuelzee.com)
The team dynamic from the start was great. We had the right amount of diversity and cohesiveness that any strong group would need to succeed. Night 1 was simple; lay out the idea on paper, get a __very__ clear understanding of the idea and what needed to be done to define it. Also, have fun. There is no doubt about it, we were there to work and to do a kick-ass job. But we were only going to do that by having fun, and we did.

### Saturday, 11/10/2012 @ 8:30a
I think the most important thing to note here is the time, 8:30a. Followed by the day, Saturday. Not much gets me out of bed this early on the weekend. But I was excited about one thing in particular this morning. User validation.

For anyone who knows me I'm a data nerd. It's what I do for a living. It's what interests me. And it's what I'm good at. Being tasked with actually going out to find user validation was so cool to me. So we came up with a small survey. We wanted to know if people would actually use what we were going to be creating: Fuelzee.

__Fuelzee__
1. Foursquare for gas stations. But with real time rewards.
2. Check in at a gas station, whether you're there to buy gas or not.
3. Get points.
4. Share it with your friends via the social network of your choice.
5. Get more points!
6. Use those points to redeem rewards on things inside of the convenience store.
7. Compete with friends for the most points and the race to become _"Oil Tycoon"_ of your favorite gas station.

So here's what we found:
- 52 people surveyed
- 57% would check in for rewards
- 82% would use an app to check in for gas prices
- 77% would go inside the station to redeem a reward
- 60% of surveyors signed up for [beta access](http://www.fuelzee.com) (that link means you should too!)

In other words, our idea was legit. Now we had to see if we could pull it off. 33 hours remaining.

[@Rae_Seen](https://twitter.com/Rae_Seen) was already hard at work on all of the graphics. Everything from the logo to the iOS mock-ups that we needed. I think she got up from her seat a total of 4 times on Saturday. [@cthomasfl](https://twitter.com/cthomasfl) and I worked on flushing out the business model while Lawrence and Brandon researched all of the key market statistics we were going to need in order to prove our viability. [@NicholasBardy](https://twitter.com/NicholasBardy) and [@AggressiveLabs](https://twitter.com/AggressiveLabs) (Destry) worked on the back end. We wanted real gas prices to fuel the data behind our app! [@Danielmcgaw](https://twitter.com/Danielmcgaw) was late! Some excuse about having to coach 2 of his kids sporting events that morning… (_obviously_ kidding!) Dan kicked ass when he got there. Quickly jumping back in to answer all of our questions and lead the group in the right direction.

We took a break finally at 9:30p to grab some drinks. We _may_ have told some of the other teams on the way out, that we were "done" ;)

I left the Plaza building that night at 2:00a. 19 hours remaining.

### Sunday, 11/11/2012 @ 9:30a
Sunday morning I had very few things on my mind. Did I want hot or cold coffee from the Voxeo café? What kind of bagel did I want? How was Fuelzee going to make its money?

It was my job that day to answer that last question. My task for the day was Fuelzee's revenue streams and financial model. We needed to be able to predict based on a forecasted user base what our revenue would look like after the first 3 years. Again, total nerd stuff + data = I'm happy.

Sunday went by way too fast. The final pitches began at 5:30p. I think we finished our final deck at 5:29p.

It's show time…

## The Pitches
Everyone, and I really do mean everyone did a really great job with their pitches. The entire weekend came down to these presentations and by no means was it "easy." Throughout the weekend as I walked around the Voxeo office and observed the other teams, everyone was solving _real_ problems. Coming up with _real_ ideas. And creating _real_ products to bring to market.

- 3rd Place: Ad Smash. A different take on web based advertisement that got the user involved. A simple question like "Which of these cars would you drive?", and your selection would automatically target the ads based on your selection.
- 2nd Place: D-Art. A global social-hub for all things art. Focusing primarily on "underground" music, poetry, painting, and spoken word. Providing a place for artists to interact with their audience and for the audience to purchase their work.
- 1st Place: Fuelzee…

I couldn't believe it. Regardless of any confidence I had before/during/after Dan's pitch, it was surreal. My first Startup Weekend event and I joined the winning team.

## Thanks
I want to thank everyone that was a part of the Fuelzee team, you guys worked harder than anyone could have asked you to. Also, we couldn't have done this without [Voxeo](http://www.voxeo.com), [Envy Labs](http://envylabs.com), [Atlantic.net](http://www.atlantic.net), [Rollins College](http://www.rollins.edu/mba/entrepreneurship/index.html), [Entrepreneurship Law Firm](http://www.orlandobusinesslawyer.com), etc.

To all the mentors who assisted us in our questions and provided your expert advice on so many wide ranging topics, thank you.

To all of the Startup Weekend staff and organizers, thank you.

I truly had a great time and cannot wait to participate in another round of Startup Weekend Orlando.
