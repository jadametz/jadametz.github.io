>“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something – your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path; and that will make all the difference.” -Steve Jobs

#Connecting the dots looking backwards
This is one of my favorite quotes pertaining to how things work out in life. Leading up to my twenty-sixth birthday, I've found my self reflecting on it a great deal. Connecting the dots looking backwards and having the confidence to lead my self off that well worn path, I've:

- Attended and won my first [Startup Weekend](http://jesseadametz.com/blog/startupweekendorlando) competition in Orlando
- Proceeded to help launch [Fuelzee](http://www.fuelzee.com) and continuously get involved with the Startup community
- Really learned how to successfully interview under multiple circumstances
- Took the biggest risk of my life yet; trusted my gut
-- Landed a job at [FindTheBest](http://jesseadametz.com/blog/findthebest) in Santa Barbara, CA.
-- Said goodbye to everyone and everything I knew in FL.
-- Drove across the country with my Father, Zoey, and my entire life packed into a 14' U-Haul
-- Met some of the most talented and ambitious people on the planet

#What's Next

Over the last 2-3 years specifically, I've tended to have a road map in mind. Goals that I was set out to accomplish. But I think that's what's different about this year. I only have one goal in mind.

To look back on twenty-six and know that I crushed it. To know that coming to CA to work on something that I'm passionate about, was worth it all. And to look back on the dots of twenty-six, connecting them all with a smile on my face.

##Thank You

If you're reading this, it's pretty unlikely that you're some random person from Internet land. In which case, thank you. Because if you're reading this you've likely had an impact on my life. You've helped me build the blocks and support that I needed to make twenty-five one of the most successful and fulfilling years yet. And I can't wait to tell you more about twenty-six.

So here's to bringing in twenty-six with new co-workers and friends, while wishing old ones were here to buy some of the drinks!

_Cheers_
