So here it is, finally (for the second time since the first blog post got "discarded")!...Wait, what is it?

My own corner of the Internet has been something I've wanted to do for a number of years. I've always come up with the idea of a design or topic, started it, disliked it, started it again, and then left it for _later_. Ultimately never coming back to it of course. This time was different though, as I found my self with some free time between semesters and wanted to finally do a project for my self.

The site is created and managed via [SquareSpace](http://www.squarespace.com), which I'd found out about via some pod-casts I recently started listening to ([Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w), [Build & Analyze](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze), [The Talk Show](http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/)). Driven by the idea of learning something new, I wanted to make a place that could serve as a "~~live resume~~" for all future projects.

I'll also be exposing my self and stepping a little outside of my comfort zone with the blog, as I've never had previous, formal, experience expressing my ideas and getting a point across about the [things]({{ site.url }}/about) I'm passionate about. I'd love for people to enjoy and take interest in the things I'll be posting and hopefully join in on the discussion! So, here it is. I'm very excited for the potential of it even if no one else ends up reading a word I write.
