There are a few quotes that I've tried to live by in 2013.

- _"Things can be better, so there is work to do. The world is not yet done."_ -Unknown / My desktop wallpaper. Daily motivation.
- _"Be the change you want to see in the world."_ -Gandhi
- _"Do what makes you come alive."_ -[Sean McCabe](https://twitter.com/seanwes/)

The last quote hits a little closer to home. It's actually on a t-shirt that I received from [Front End Conf](http://frontendconf.com) this year. A conference which left me completely motivated and inspired to find something that I would love to work on.

Ironically, it's also where this story begins. Because on day 1 of the conference, I was contacted by [FindTheBest](http://www.findthebest.com/about-us), a Santa Barbara startup focused on turning consumers into experts.

I'm happy to announce that I will be moving to [Santa Barbara](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=Santa+Barbara%2C+CA&data=!1m4!1m3!1d53752!2d-119.702067!3d34.4281937!4m11!1m10!4m8!1m3!1d28039!2d-81.30229!3d28.5420291!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!17b1), CA. and joining the FindTheBest team as of September 30th. Santa Barbara is the most beautiful city I've visited to date and I'm excited for the opportunity to call it home. Family, friends, and Florida will be missed (the weather will not).

I'm thankful to have this opportunity and embark on something that I think will live up to the quote on that t-shirt. I can't wait to be surrounded by all the talented people who I will soon call "team".
