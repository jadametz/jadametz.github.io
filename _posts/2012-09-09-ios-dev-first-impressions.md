##Some Background
In January of 2010 I began taking classes for a Masters of Science degree in Modeling & Simulation. As with most other things I've done since high school, one of the requirements was a "base knowledge of computer programming". And, as with most other things I've done, I convinced my self that my core-knowledge of _programming concepts_ was enough to get me by. In the Fall of that same year I decided to be a little more realistic. I put the MS degree on hold and enrolled in the Computer Programming & Analysis AS degree program at [Valencia](http://www.valenciacollege.edu).

Years earlier my roommate at the time, [Zac](http://zacwe.st) was a Computer Science major and was working nights on [Prowl](http://www.prowlapp.com) which is an iOS application that allows you to create custom push notifications.

The combination of watching him embark on iOS development and my own interest in programming as a hobby has kept me interested in iOS development since the beginning. And now, I'm finally getting a chance to try it out for my self.

##The Lectures
The class is new to Valencia so (thankfully) they've branched out and used the iTunes U lectures from Stanford University as the delivery method. There are still physical class lectures that I attend every Monday night. However, this time is reserved to dive deeper into the lectures and get hand's on with the code (as the lectures from Stanford tend to move fairly fast).

So far, only two lectures in to the course and we've already started developing a calculator.

##Xcode, iOS SDK, Objective-C
I'm not an experienced enough developer on the Mac/iOS to know any of Xcode's shortcomings. But, my first impressions are, I __really__ like it! Coming from a background of primarily MS Visual Studio, Xcode is a welcome change in scenery.

The iOS SDK has made it so simple to (as with the calculator example) place buttons on the screen, group them, and immediately start writing code to back them up. Aside from the custom skins and graphics that are now typical on a lot of apps, Apple does a great job at providing the beginner developer everything they'd need to really create a great quality app.

Objective-C is going to prove interesting to learn. I'm excited to learn it because ultimately if I ever did pursue programming as a career, I'd want it to be either Web or Apple based. I'm confident I could never enjoy programming in the Windows environment for more than a short period. I've already discovered that Objective-C right from the beginning requires the programmer to be self-motivated. Documentation is key to understanding the fully power of the language and learning its potential.

##Going forward
I'm looking forward to seeing how the projects in the class evolve. As the class proceeds I'll be writing more about the process, showing how the projects are taking shape and describing my experiences so far with learning the new environment. 

Keep in mind, the goal after this class is write my own iPhone and/or iPad app to hopefully sell on the App Store.
